# Etch-A-Sketch Game

Building a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an etch-a-sketch.
The main take away is to get a better grasp of my DOM skills and I can tell it wont be easy. 

## 16x16 grid
The goal is to have 16x16 square div grid, but can be scaled down or up, * n X n*. Allowing user to decide how many divs they
want. 

## Creating the Grid
This was the easiest part, took me a couple of hours. I used little to no examples. 
 
## Rainbow Effect on Cells 
This was the hardest part, I refactored the actual function that retrieves the color - getColorPercentage(key) function from <here> https://codepen.io/mradamcole/pen/yWXyPz 

I also received assitance on refactoring from my mentor, he helped make it more concise and understandable for how I needed it to function.
