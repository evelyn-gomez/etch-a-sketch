# Etch-A-Sketch Game

Building a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an etch-a-sketch.
The main take away is to get a better grasp of my DOM skills and I can tell it wont be easy.

The goal is to have 16x16 square div grid, but can be scaled down or up, * n X n*. Allowing user to decide how many divs they
want.
